## 🎯 Project Objective

To simulate a real-world data analytics scenario where we:
- Build an **interactive transportation analytics dashboard**.
- Track **freight costs, shipment performance, and carrier optimization**.
- Provide **scenario-based insights** for strategic planning.

---

## 🛠 Tools & Skills Used
- **Power BI**
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)**
- **Power Query (M Language)**
- Data Cleaning & Transformation
- KPI Creation & Drill-through Features
- Filters, Slicers, and Conditional Formatting
- **Scenario Modeling**
- **Power BI Service – Report Publishing & Sharing**

## 🗂️ Dataset Overview

The dataset contains:
- **Shipment details** (Route, Carrier, Mode, Weight, Distance)
- **Cost components** (Base Cost, Fuel Adjustment, Total Freight Cost)
- **Performance metrics** (Delivery Days, Mode Type)
- **Scenario data** (Mode Shift, Carrier Optimization)

## 📌 Key KPIs Displayed

| KPI                             | Description                        |
|--------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Total Freight Cost             | Sum of all shipment costs         |
| Total Shipments                | Count of all shipment records     |
| Average Cost per Shipment      | Total Cost ÷ Total Shipments      |
| Top 10 Costly Routes           | Highest cost routes analysis      |
| Mode-wise Cost Distribution    | Breakdown of costs by transport mode |

## 📈 Insights Generated

- **Road mode** accounted for the highest freight costs, followed by **Air shipments**.
- **10% Mode Shift from Air → Rail** significantly reduced overall costs.
- **Carrier Optimization (70% allocation to cheapest carrier)** improved savings by **X%**.
- High-cost routes concentrated in **[Region/State]**, indicating scope for route optimization.
